[![CI](https://github.com/ShipitSmarter/vscode-stitch/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ShipitSmarter/vscode-stitch/actions/workflows/main.yml?query=branch%3Amaster) [![Marketplace Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/shipitsmarter.vscode-stitch.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shipitsmarter.vscode-stitch)

This is a vscode extension to help with creating, testing and debugging Stitch integration files. Within an integration we support using scriban for templating.

To get started open the *Command Palette* (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`) and search for `Stitch: Preview`

Once the command is executed the Preview window appears to the right of your current open document.

Another way to start the preview is opening a `*.integration.json` file and clicking the icon in the titlebar.
