This is a vscode extension to help with creating, testing and debugging Stitch integration files. Within an integration we support using scriban for templating.

To get started open the *Command Palette* (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`) and search for `Stitch: Preview`

Once the command is executed the Preview window appears to the right of your current open document.

Another way to start the preview is opening a `*.integration.json|yaml` file and clicking the icon in the titlebar.
